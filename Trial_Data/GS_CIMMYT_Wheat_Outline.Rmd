#Objective

Set up a genomic selection for CIMMYT wheat trials.  The data included are a hapmap file that has previously been imputed using Beagle.  The phenotype data file consist of 3 site years of data, 14_OBR_EYT--2014 Drought, 15_OBR_EYT -- 2015 Drought, 14_OBR_EYTHeat -- 2015 heat.  Note that not all phenotypes were included each year.  The lines were grouped into trials, with trials composing sister (highly related lines).

The phenotype information includes:  
GID_DNA:  This is the individual unique number that links to the hapmap file
blup_gs1:  Model estimated value for NDVI 1st measurement 	
blup_gs2:	Model estimated value for NDVI 2nd measurement
blup_gs3: Model estimated value for NDVI 3rd measurement	
blup_n1:	Model estimated value for canopy temperature 1st measurement
blup_n2:	Model estimated value for canopy temperature 2nd measurement
blup_n3:	Model estimated value for canopy temperature 3rd measurement
Experiment_id:  Identifies year and type of experiment heat or drought	
Entry:  Entry number	
cimmyt_tid:  CIMMYT Trial ID, grouping of individuals into trial	
notes:  notes	
gy_effect:  Estimated BLUP (0 centered) of grain yield	
gs: average of blup_gs1, blup_gs2, blup_gs3, and blup_gs4	
ir: average of blup_n1, blup_n2, blup_n3, blup_n4	
model: information about the model used to calcuate trial BLUPs	
blup_gs4:	Model estimated value for NDVI 4th measurement
blup_n4: Model estimated value for canopy temperature 4th measurement

#Objective 1:  Set up a model using only the drought 2014 data for grain yield.
